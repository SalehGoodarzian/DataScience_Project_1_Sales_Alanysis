I have combined 12 csv files for 12 months which are data from sales of electronic parts. I have answered several questions in this work. I have reproduced the work done in the YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4&t=239s) and data are from this video, but I have written the codes my way, particularly in question 4, I proposed a simpler method. I am thankful to Keith Gally who created this great educational video. I am sharing my work here for interested people to see how I have done it...
